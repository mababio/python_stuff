# python_stuff

I'll be devoting my time to solely Python and Devopsy stuff and I figured along the way I'll be creating useful Linux command tools in python. So why not share it with the world.


What tools I created so far:

- Auomated Amazon S3 file uploader.
- Caller-ID using twilio look-up feature
