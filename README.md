# python_stuff

I'll be devoting my time to solely Python and Devopsy stuff and I figured along the way I'll be creating useful Linux command tools in python. So why not share it with the world.


What tools I created so far:

- [Auomated Amazon S3 file uploader](https://github.com/mababio/python_stuff/tree/master/resume_updater)
- [Caller-ID using twilio look-up feature](https://github.com/mababio/python_stuff/tree/master/Twilio_Name)
